      <div>People usually get sick with adenoviruses when they spend time with large groups of people (for example, at universities, hospitals, or schools). There are over 50 different types of adenoviruses. Usually adenoviruses cause mild illness, but sometimes they can be serious. The types of symptoms you have depend on which type of adenovirus you have and the part of the body that the virus is affecting. Adenoviruses most commonly cause respiratory illness, which can range from cold and flu-like symptoms to bronchitis and pneumonia. Some adenoviruses can cause diarrhea or pink eye, and in rare cases, inflammation of the bladder or severe neurological disease. Anyone can get sick from an adenovirus. People with a weakened immune system, or those who have lung or heart problems are more likely to become very sick from an adenovirus. Antibiotics do not work against adenoviruses.</div>

As of December 19, 2019, the CDC reports that 138 people in 25 states are infected with the outbreak strain of STEC. There have been 72 people hospitalized and 13 cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a type of kidney failure. No deaths have been reported. As of December 19, 2019, Wisconsin has 33 confirmed cases linked to this outbreak. Of these, 14 people have been hospitalized and 2 have developed HUS.</div>

      <div>The Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) is working with the Buffalo County Health Department, the Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection (DATCP), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) regarding a confirmed case of hepatitis A virus infection in a food handler. A food handler with hepatitis A infection is concerning because of the potential for food contamination. This individual worked at the Mondovi Hansen&#8217;s IGA store deli while they were able to spread Hepatitis A, from October 28 through November 17, 2019. Health officials are advising people who shopped at the Mondovi Hansen&#8217;s IGA during October 28 and November 17, 2019 and ate produce or deli items to call their doctor. They should ask about their risk of exposure to hepatitis A virus and options for vaccination (if not already vaccinated). There is no risk of exposure outside of these dates.</div>
      <div>A single, common supplier of these berries has not been identified and no recall has been issued at this time. Ill patients reported eating fresh, non-organic blackberries from Fresh Thyme Farmers Market or Woodman's Market stores in Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, and Wisconsin. As of December 11, 2019, the CDC reports that 18 people in six states are infected with the outbreak strains of hepatitis A. Wisconsin has five confirmed cases linked to this outbreak. Three cases in Wisconsin have been hospitalized. Ill patients reported their illnesses starting between October 15 and November 5, 2019.</div>
