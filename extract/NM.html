      <div>New Mexico has identified cases of COVID-19. We are currently working to continue identifying cases as early as possible and implement isolation procedures to prevent further spread of the virus. Those procedures currently focus on 1) monitoring asymptomatic travelers from countries with CDC Travel Health Alerts</div>
      <div>Based on years of planning for the next influenza pandemic, a virus that is similar to the novel coronavirus, we have adapted our plans based on current knowledge of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. We have focused on measures to track the cases identified in New Mexico, to prevent spread of infections through social distancing, to ensure continuity of the healthcare system where patient volumes may require supplemental care sites, and to anticipate special approaches to effectively manage the needs that New Mexicans have for information and healthcare services. We are also stepping up our efforts to communicate what we know about COVID-19.
