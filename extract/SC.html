      <div>The ZIP-code level information here as well as the heat map available here indicate reported cases of COVID-19 for the previous 14 days, as that is the time-frame for when an individual would be contagious. However, there are many people within our communities who have the virus and have never been tested, and because of this, we&#8217;ll never have information that accurately represents every case of COVID-19. Regardless of the number of reported cases within an area, all South Carolinians should take seriously the recommended precautions for protecting against this disease.</div>
