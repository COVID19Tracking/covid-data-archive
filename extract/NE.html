      <div>For most Nebraskans, COVID-19 will be like a cold, however this illness is anything but the common cold or flu. For our parents and grandparents, it could be very severe, and could result in death. Recent data shows that the virus is also affecting younger people. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report said 20% of those hospitalized for COVID-19 in the U.S. were 20-44 years old. Even if you're healthy, you can pass COVID-19 on to people who could be severely affected. Help protect those you love by avoiding crowds, distancing yourself from other people and isolating yourself even if you think you just have a case of the sniffles.
