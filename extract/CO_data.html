            <p>*Originally we classified cases as apresumptive positivea until they could be re-tested by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). The CDC confirmed we no longer need to send positive cases for re-testing because the test they perform is identical to the CDPHE testing. Therefore, all positive cases reported here are confirmed positive.</p>
            <p>**Now that private labs are conducting testing, the positive cases number represents all positive cases in the state. Private labs are not required to report negative numbers to the state, so we are not reporting total numbers of negative cases.</p>
            <p>Please note: information may change slightly as more information is collected on each patient.</p>

<span>Due to the high volume of tests being processed by the state lab and a need to get the information out quickly, today&#226;&#128;&#153;s case summary does not contain a demographic breakdown. Demographic data will be provided as soon as the lab is able to provide the statistical breakdown</span>
