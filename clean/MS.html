<h3>COVID-19 Testing</h3>
<div>
<p>The MSDH Public Health Laboratory is testing samples submitted by Mississippi physicians and healthcare providers around the state in cases where COVID-19 is determined to be a risk.
Anyone with flu-like symptoms of fever, severe cough or severe chest pains &#8211; especially those who are older or in poor health &#8211; should call their doctor or healthcare provider for instructions on safely being examined.
Healthcare providers can assess your health history and symptoms, and perform testing for COVID-19 as needed.

<h2 id="prevention">Prevention and Preparedness</h2>
<h3>For Individuals</h3>
<p>Protect yourself and others with these steps:</p> 
<ul>
<li>Stay home if you are sick, and avoid close contact with anyone who is ill.</li>
<li>Cover your coughs and sneezes. When possible, cough, sneeze or blow your nose into a tissue, and throw the tissue away.</li>
<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.</li>
<li>Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly, especially after coughing or sneezing, blowing your nose, and using the bathroom. Effective handwashing takes about 20 seconds,
and includes cleaning under fingernails, between fingers, and washing the back of hands as well as the front. <a href="14,0,330.html">More proper handwashing tips &#187; </a>
</li>
<li>Clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that are touched often.</li>
<li>Stay in good overall health by eating right and staying active. If you are living with diabetes, heart disease or other condition, keep in touch with your doctor and stay current with your treatment.</li>
<li>During or before flu season, get a flu shot. Flu vaccination can prevent the flu or make it less severe, and decrease your chance of hospitalization and death. It also keeps you healthier and better able to fight off infections.</li>
<li>If you are sick, especially with shortness of breath, cough, fever or similar flu-like symptoms, call a doctor or healthcare provider.</li>
</ul>

<h4>New recommendations as of March 16, 2020</h4>
<div>
 <ul>
 <li>Avoid social gatherings where <strong>10</strong> people or more would come into close contact. This does not apply to schools or businesses, which should make their own decisions to limit activities or attendance.</li>
 <li>To prevent illness in those most vulnerable, anyone 65 or older OR with a chronic medical condition should avoid <strong>all</strong> social gatherings.</li>
 <li>Avoid unnecessary (non-urgent) air, bus or train travel.</li>
 <li>Limit visitation to older relatives or friends (especially in nursing or care homes).</li>
 <li>Prepare for the possibility that schools or day care centers may temporarily close.</li>
 </ul>

<h3 id="highrisk">For People at High Risk</h3>
<p>People at risk for serious illness from COVID-19 are older adults and those with a chronic illness such as heart disease, diabetes, or lung disease. These people should take simple precautions at all times to limit their exposure to others who may be ill:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Avoid social gatherings.</li>
 <li>Keep more space (6 feet if possible) between you and others as you go through the day.</li>
 <li>Avoid crowds. When you do go out in public, keep away from others who are sick and limit close contact.</li>
 <li>Wash your hands often, especially after being in public places.</li>
</ul>

<p>If COVID-19 begins to spread locally, you should stay home as much as possible. Having a supply of important medications and basic supplies can help.</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="facilities">For Long-Term Care Facilities</h3>
<ul>
 <li>MSDH recommends discontinuing group social activities.</li>
 <li>Consider restricting visitation until further notice. </li>
 <li>Post signs that discourage all nonessential visitation and discourage ill visitors from entering the facility.</li>
 <li>Visitors should only visit their family members and should not have contact with other residents since they could spread the virus.</li>
 <li>Visitors should cover their coughs and be educated on the importance of hand hygiene.</li>
 <li>Keep all ill visitors away from the facility for at least 48 hours after symptoms resolve.</li>
 <li>Consider limiting visitation by children (especially during community wide outbreaks) and the elderly or those with underlying medical problems that place them at risk. </li>
 <li>Postpone all groups (like school groups or church groups) from visiting facility &#8212; this goes along with discontinuing all group activities. </li>
 <li>Make sure the facility has plenty of hand washing products and that visitors have access to them.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Schools, Gatherings and Events</h3>
<p>Everyone attending mass gatherings should take extra precautions at this time, including:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Maintain social distancing as much as practical. A separation of 6 feet from another person is considered effective for infection control.</li>
 <li>Wash hands frequently and thoroughly soap and water, or use hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available. Look for sanitizers with at least 60 percent alcohol..</li>
 <li>If ill, do not attend any public event and call your physician or healthcare provider if needed.</li>
 <li>Schools throughout the state should consider cancelling any mass gatherings, including assembly and social events.</li>
 <li>The Mississippi State Department of Health is not advising the closing of schools at this time.</li>
