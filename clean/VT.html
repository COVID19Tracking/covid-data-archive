Phil Scott called on Vermonters to help protect our most vulnerable &#173;&#8211; the elderly and the very ill &#173;&#8211; and announced several strategies to help slow the spread of the new coronavirus. They include restricting visitor access at long-term care facilities, prohibiting non-essential gatherings of more than 50 people or 50% of a location's capacity, whichever number is lower, and suspending&#160;out-of-state travel for state employees. Gov. Scott declared a state of emergency to help ensure Vermont has all the necessary resources to respond to this evolving threat.

                          <h3>How can I protect myself?</h3>
                          <p>There is currently&#160;no vaccine to prevent COVID-19&#160;infection. Person-to-person spread of the virus is thought to occur mainly via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Much is still unknown about how the virus spreads. Take these everyday preventive actions to help stop the spread of germs:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.</li>
                            <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
                            <li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
                            <li>Stay home when you are sick.</li>
                            <li>Cover your coughs and sneezes with your sleeve or a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash and wash your hands.</li>
                            <li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>If you traveled to affected locations or were on a cruise (see Guidance for Travelers on this page) within the past two weeks or have been in close contact with a person with COVID-19, and develop a fever, cough or have difficulty breathing, contact your health care provider right away.</p>

                            <strong>What is social distancing?</strong>
                          </p>
                          <p>Coronavirus spreads easily from person to person. It travels through the air when a sick person coughs or sneezes. One way to contain the spread of COVID-19 is to stop people from sharing it. Without a vaccine or treatment, we can help contain the virus by staying at least six feet apart from one another. This means limiting the number of times you physically interact with other people. It will make an enormous difference if people follow social distancing guidelines:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              <strong>Avoid any activities that put you close to other people</strong>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              <strong>Limit contact with family members and friends who are sick</strong>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              <strong>Wash your hands every time you go inside</strong>
                            </li>
                          </ul>

                              <strong>How can people with young children practice social distancing?</strong>
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>If your child is sick, keep your child home</li>
                              <li>Avoid group playdates or parties indoors</li>
                              <li>Avoid crowded activities (movie theaters, gymnastics, ice skating rinks, etc.), even if they&#8217;re still open</li>
                              <li>Encourage teenagers to keep gatherings small. Remember, the lower the number, the lower the risk.</li>
                              <li>Bring hand sanitizer with you to the playground and clean shared sports equipment regularly</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Spend time outdoors as a family or consider individual outdoor activities like biking or hiking, as it&#8217;s easier to keep a good distance from each other. Take advantage of technology to play games or keep in touch with friends. Some of these changes will be difficult, but we can all do our part to slow down this pandemic.</p>
                            <p>
                              <strong>Staying connected while social distancing.</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>During this time of uncertainty, many Vermonters are feeling understandably angry, worried, and scared. Social distancing can compound the feeling of isolation. We encourage all Vermonters to use this time of social distancing as an opportunity to reconnect with family, friends, and your community in responsible ways. Use technology to communicate, enjoy the outdoors, take time to learn a new skill, follow up on long-overdue projects, or volunteer to support those who may be in need.</p>
                            <p>This is a big transition in how we all live our daily lives &#8211; we&#8217;re all working together to adjust, change the way we express kindness and affection to others. Knowing this &#8211; all being in this together &#8211; goes into all of the difficult decisions the State is making.</p>

                          <p>Regarding large events of any size, it is reasonable for older adults and persons with underlying health conditions to consider not attending.</p>

                          <p>While Vermonters are staying home or choosing activities that maintain social distancing as much as possible to slow the spread of COVID-19, some are stepping up to ensure their neighbors have what they need. This type of community support is crucial, but we need to make sure our helpers and volunteers are still using social distancing practices to protect our most vulnerable Vermonters.</p>
                          <p>Any volunteers bringing items to those who need to stay home should:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Keep a distance of six feet away.</li>
                            <li>Avoid entering the recipient&#8217;s home.</li>
                            <li>Wash your hands regularly, avoid touching your face and cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.</li>

                              <p>Emergency medical services (EMS) play a vital role in responding to requests for assistance, triaging patients, and providing emergency medical treatment and transport for ill persons. However, unlike patient care in the controlled environment of a healthcare facility, care and transports by EMS present unique challenges because of the nature of the setting, enclosed space during transport, frequent need for rapid medical decision-making, interventions with limited information, and a varying range of patient acuity and jurisdictional healthcare resources.
