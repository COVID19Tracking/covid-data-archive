<p>Gov. Phil Scott has announced a Continuity of Education Plan for the orderly dismissal of all schools, and cancellation of all school related activities, no later than Wednesday, March 18. <a href="https://governor.vermont.gov/press-release/gov-scott-orders-orderly-closure-vermont-prek-12-schools-week">Read more</a></p>

Gov. Phil Scott called on Vermonters to help protect our most vulnerable &#173;&#8211; the elderly and the very ill &#173;&#8211; and announced several strategies to help slow the spread of the new coronavirus. They include restricting visitor access at long-term care facilities, prohibiting non-essential gatherings of more than 50 people and suspending&#160;out-of-state travel for state employees. Gov. Scott declared a state of emergency to help ensure Vermont has all the necessary resources to respond to this evolving threat. <a href="https://governor.vermont.gov/sites/scott/files/documents/EO%2001-20%20Declaration%20of%20State%20of%20Emergency%20in%20Response%20to%20COVID-19%20and%20National%20Guard%20Call-Out.pdf">Read the executive order</a><br><a href="/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-Exec-Order-details.pdf">What this means for Vermonters</a></p>

  <div>
    Preventing Illness  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>How can I protect myself?</h3>

<p>There is currently&#160;no vaccine to prevent COVID-19&#160;infection. Person-to-person spread of the virus is thought to occur mainly via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Much is still unknown about how the virus spreads. Take these everyday preventive actions to help stop the spread of germs:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.</li>
	<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
	<li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
	<li>Stay home when you are sick.</li>
	<li>Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.</li>
	<li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you traveled to affected locations (see Guidance for Travelers on this page) within the past two weeks or have been in close contact with a person with COVID-19, and develop a fever, cough or have difficulty breathing, contact your health care provider right away.</p>

<h3>Cleaning your hands, and recipe for hand sanitizer</h3>

<p><strong>CDC recommends the following for hand hygiene: </strong></p>

<p>Household members should <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/when-how-handwashing.html">clean hands</a></p>

<p><strong>Hand Sanitizer Recipe</strong> (based on recipe from the <a href="https://www.who.int/gpsc/5may/Guide_to_Local_Production.pdf">World Health Organization</a></p>

<ul>
<li>1 cup (250 mL) isopropyl alcohol (91%)</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon (5 mL) glycerol (or other moisturizer such as aloe vera gel, warm honey or olive oil)</li>
	<li>2 Tablespoons (33 mL) water</li>
</ul>
<p>Add the ingredients in the order listed above to a clean container, mixing with a spoon. If using honey, stir until the honey is completely dissolved. Keep this mixture out of the reach of children. The final concentration of isopropyl alcohol in this mixture is 75%, so keep it away from flames.</p>

<h3>Should I wear a face mask when I go out in public?</h3>

<div>The Department of Health does not&#160;recommend&#160;people wear a face mask in public.</div>

<div>
<strong>If you are sick:</strong>&#160;If you are ill, stay home to rest and avoid going out into public places. If you are ill and plan to see a doctor, you should call the office before your visit. Your doctor can provide guidance on how to avoid spreading illness, such as what steps to take while traveling to their facility and upon arrival, and whether you should wear a mask.</div>

<div>
<strong>If you are not sick:</strong>&#160;You do not need to wear a mask. Face masks are more effective at &#8220;keeping germs in,&#8221; but they are not as effective at &#8220;keeping germs out.&#8221;</div>

    Monitoring  </div>

  <div>
    <h3><strong>What does monitoring mean?</strong></h3>

<p>Monitoring is for people who do not have symptoms and who have traveled to affected areas. It means checking your temperature daily, watching for symptoms, and for some people, staying home.</p>

<h3>Information for people under monitoring</h3>

<p>This follows guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and is subject to change.&#160;</p>

<p><strong>Travelers Returning from Europe, the United&#160;Kingdom, Ireland,&#160;</strong><strong>China, Iran and South Korea</strong></p>

<p>Returning travelers from Europe, the United Kingdom, Ireland China, Iran and South Korea should&#160;<strong>stay home</strong>,<strong>&#160;</strong>practice social distancing&#160;and monitor their health for 14 days after returning to the United States. Social distancing means remaining out of congregate settings, avoiding mass gatherings and maintaining distance (approximately 6 feet or 2 meters) from others when possible. If you have members in your household who did not travel, they&#160;do not need to be monitored and do not need to stay home. Call Health Department epidemiology and infectious disease&#160;staff&#160;at 802-863-7240 if you haven&#8217;t been in contact with them already.&#160;If you develop symptoms:</p>

<ul>
<li>Call your health care provider right away.</li>
	<li>Before you go to an appointment, let your health care provider know that you are being monitored for novel coronavirus and your travel history.</li>
	<li>Call Health Department&#160;epidemiology and infectious disease&#160;staff at 802-863-7240.</li>
	<li>Avoid contact with others.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>People in close contact with a person who tested positive for COVID-19</strong></p>

<p>People who have been identified by the Health Department as a close contact to someone who tested positive for COVID-19&#160;should stay home, practice social distancing and monitor their health for 14 days. Social distancing means remaining out of congregate settings, avoiding mass gatherings&#160;and maintaining distance (approximately 6 feet or 2 meters) from others when possible. The Health Department will be in contact with you regularly during the monitoring period. If you have members in your household who are not a close contact of someone who tested positive for COVID-19, they do not need to self-monitor and do not need to stay home. If you develop symptoms:</p>

<ul>
<li>Call your health care provider right away.</li>
	<li>Before you go to an appointment, let your health care provider know that you are being monitored for novel coronavirus.</li>
	<li>Call Health Department epidemiology and infectious disease&#160;staff at 802-863-7240.</li>
	<li>Avoid contact with others.</li>

    What does close contact mean?  </div>

  <div>
    <p>Close contact means being within&#160;six feet&#160;of someone who has&#160;tested positive for COVID-19 for a long time.&#160;This happens when caring for, being intimate partners with, living with, visiting, or sharing a health care waiting area. If you have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19: stay home, limit contact with others, and call Health Department Epidemiology at 802-863-7240 to discuss whether&#160;you need to see a provider and how you will monitor yourself for symptoms.&#160;When someone tests positive for COVID-19, the Health Department conducts outreach to close contacts of the individual.&#160;</p>

<p>Close contact does not mean: being more than six feet away in the same indoor environment for a long period of time,&#160;walking&#160;by, or&#160;briefly being in the same room with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. In these situations, you should observe yourself for symptoms. You do not need to call the Health Department.&#160;</p>

<p>Anyone who develops symptoms&#160;should stay home and call their health care provider.</p>

<p>You can read more about risk assessment in Table 1 and Table 2&#160;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/risk-assessment.html">here</a></p>

    <h3>Who can get tested for COVID-19?</h3>

<p>If you are ill, call your health care provider to find out if you should be seen for an evaluation and consideration of testing. Health care providers may decide to test the following people for COVID-19:</p>

<ul>
<li>A person who has&#160;symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and is hospitalized.</li>
	<li>A person &#8211; whether hospitalized or in an outpatient setting &#173;&#8211; who has&#160;symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and a travel history to an affected area or had close contact with another person who tested positive for COVID-19.</li>
	<li>A person who is ill and a&#160;health care provider believes their&#160;symptoms could be due to COVID-19.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Your health care provider will arrange for testing.</strong></p>

<p>The state will ensure that anyone who meets the medical requirements for testing for COVID-19 can do so at no cost.</p>

<h3>What is the turnaround time for testing?</h3>

<p>Results from the Vermont Department of Health Laboratory will be available in 24-48 hours. Test results will be reported by the Health Department Laboratory to the hospital or clinical lab where the test was collected. Individuals should wait for their health care provider to notify them of their test results.</p>

    What should people planning large gatherings in Vermont do?   </div>

  <div>
    <p>The CDC has updated recommendations for non-essential mass gatherings. As of March 15, Governor Scott has amended his emergency declaration to prohibit gatherings of more than 50 people or 50% of a location's capacity.</p>

<p>A "non-essential mass gathering" does NOT include normal operations at airports, bus or railway stations people may be in transit.</p>

<p>Regarding large events of any size, it is reasonable for older adults and persons with underlying health conditions to consider not attending.</p>

    <p><strong>Plan ways to care for those in your home who might be at greater risk for serious complications</strong>, like older adults and persons who have underlying chronic (long-lasting) medical conditions. Make sure those who need regular medicine, medical supplies and equipment have what they need.&#160;</p>

<p><strong>Choose a room in your home that can be used to separate sick household members from those who are healthy.</strong>&#160;Identify a separate bathroom for the sick person to use, if possible. Plan to clean these rooms, as needed, when someone is sick.</p>

<p><strong>Get support from others. </strong>Talk with your neighbors about emergency planning. If your neighborhood has a <a href="https://frontporchforum.com/">Front Porch Forum</a></p>

<p><strong>Take care of the emotional health of your household members.</strong>&#160;Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children. Talk with your children about the outbreak, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe.</p>

    What to do if you are sick  </div>

  <div>
    <ul>
<li>
<strong>Stay home and call your doctor.</strong> People who are mildly ill with COVID-19 are able to isolate at home during their illness. Call ahead before visiting your doctor. Do not go to the doctor's office unless instructed to do so. Anyone who does not have a health care provider can call 2-1-1 to be connected to a clinic in their area.</li>
	<li>
<strong>Do not go to or visit any hospitals or long-term care facilities unless absolutely necessary</strong>. This is to protect everyone&#8217;s health, including patients and staff.</li>
	<li>
<strong>Separate yourself from other people and animals in your home</strong>. As much as possible, you should stay in a specific room and away from other people and animals in your home. Also, you should use a separate bathroom, if available. Avoid sharing personal household items.</li>
	<li><strong>Wear a facemask if you are sick around other people and pets.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Cover your coughs and sneezes and clean your hands often. </strong></li>
	<li>
<strong>Clean all &#8220;high-touch&#8221; surfaces every day. </strong>These include counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables.</li>

<p>Emergency medical services (EMS) play a vital role in responding to requests for assistance, triaging patients, and providing emergency medical treatment and transport for ill persons. However, unlike patient care in the controlled environment of a healthcare facility, care and transports by EMS present unique challenges because of the nature of the setting, enclosed space during transport, frequent need for rapid medical decision-making, interventions with limited information, and a varying range of patient acuity and jurisdictional healthcare resources.

    <p>We understand staff, parents, and students may have questions and concerns about the novel (new) coronavirus disease (COVID-19), particularly if you have staff or students with ties to or recent travel to a country with a COVID-19 outbreak.&#160;We are not currently making a recommendation that events or extracurricular activities be canceled. As always, we recommend that people stay home when sick, cover their cough, and practice good hand hygiene. These recommendations are especially important during cold and flu season.</p>

<p>The State of Vermont has&#160;formed a task force to ensure communications and resources specific to Vermont will be&#160;available<span><span>&#160;throughout all sectors of the public, including businesses, schools, emergency responders and local government. </span></span></p>
