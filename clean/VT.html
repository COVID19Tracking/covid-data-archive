                          <h3>How can I protect myself?</h3>
                          <p>There is currently&#160;no vaccine to prevent COVID-19&#160;infection. Person-to-person spread of the virus is thought to occur mainly via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Currently, there is no evidence to show that COVID-19 is spread through food, mail or paper products. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.</p>
                          <p>Take these everyday preventive actions to help stop the spread of germs:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Stay at least 6 feet away from others. Stay home as much as possible.</li>
                            <li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
                            <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
                            <li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
                            <li>Stay home and practice social distancing if you must go out.</li>
                            <li>Cover your coughs and sneezes with your sleeve or a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash and wash your hands.</li>
                            <li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe</li>
                            <li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Always wash your hands if your hands are visibly dirty.</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>If you traveled to affected locations or were on a cruise (see the Travel section&#160;on this page) within the past two weeks or have been in close contact with a person with COVID-19, and develop a fever, cough or have difficulty breathing, contact your health care provider right away.</p>

                            <p>During this time of uncertainty, many Vermonters are feeling understandably angry, worried, and scared. Staying away from friends and family can make the feeling of isolation worse. We encourage all Vermonters to&#160;keep connections with family, friends, and your community in new ways. Use technology to communicate, enjoy the outdoors, take time to learn a new skill, follow up on long-overdue projects, or volunteer to support those who may be in need. It is important to get outside for fresh air and exercise. Spend time outdoors as a family or consider individual outdoor activities like biking or hiking, as it's easier to keep a good distance from each other.</p>
                            <p>This is a big transition in how we all live our daily lives &#8211; we&#8217;re all working together to adjust, change the way we express kindness and affection to others. Knowing this &#8211; all being in this together &#8211; goes into all of the difficult decisions the State is making.</p>

                          <p>Living with uncertainty during the outbreak of COVID-19 is stressful for everyone. &#160;Health, financial and other concerns can increase anxiety. Things that were normal a few weeks ago are no longer the norm. Physical distancing (also called social distancing) makes it impossible to see friends or visit family in person. &#160;At this time, we need to adopt &#8220;distant socializing&#8221;, which involves the creative use of technology, phone lines and the mail to connect. But it&#8217;s not the same. &#160;The Vermont Department of Mental Health has compiled some tips to help us get through this unsettling time.</p>
                          <h3>Get the Facts</h3>
                          <p>What we know about COVID-19 is rapidly changing. Misinformation spreads fast. We need trustworthy information from reliable sources like:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>

                          <p>It helps to limit our exposure to media sources or social media that lead to fear or panic.</p>
                          <h3>Be kind to yourself</h3>
                          <p>The COVID-19 outbreak can add to existing daily challenges. It is normal for an outbreak to be stressful.

                          <h3>Identify the source of your anxiety</h3>
                          <p>This may seem ridiculous. Obviously, it&#8217;s COVID-19. But what specifically is worrying? Is it the uncertainty, the health risk to ourselves or our loved ones, or our financial burdens? Identifying specific concerns can help us get distance and feel less overwhelmed.</p>
                          <h3>Let your anxiety be a unifying force</h3>
                          <p>So, we&#8217;ve recognized things are uncertain, acknowledged our specific worries, now what? Mental health experts recommend connecting with others,&#160;asking for what we need and offering help. Use technology to make connections. A simple phone call or an online meet-up (like FaceTime, Skype or Zoom) with family or friends can be supportive and ease loneliness. Or join

                          <h3>Self-Care is Key</h3>

                          <h3>Maintain Healthy Routines</h3>
                          <p>COVID-19 and concerns about getting sick change our daily routines. Having our day-to-day practices disrupted or even ended for a while can be a source of anxiety. Starting today, we can create new routines that support our well-being. Begin the day with a walk outside or a workout, build-in healthy breaks throughout the day, and then choose fun evening activities like watching a movie, writing in a journal, playing a musical instrument or a game, and of course, talking with friends and family on the phone or an online platform. Adding fun activities and exercise to our new routines can help alleviate isolation and disruption.</p>
                          <h3>Domestic Violence Resources</h3>
                          <p>What if you are isolated (or quarantined) with your abuser? Reach out for the help you need. Law Enforcement are continuing to respond to calls. Hotlines and shelters will remain open. Contact the Vermont Network for more information about your local organization.</p>

                          <p>Vermonters are being asked to stay home, except for essential activities. However, there are currently no travel restrictions for travel within the U.S. or specific health-related recommendations upon return. However, cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been reported in many states, and some areas are experiencing community spread of the disease. Crowded travel settings, like airports, may increase chances of getting COVID-19, if there are other travelers with coronavirus infection. There are several things you should consider when deciding whether it is safe for you to travel.</p>

                          <p>While Vermonters are staying home to slow the spread of COVID-19, some are stepping up to ensure their neighbors have what they need. This type of community support is crucial, but we need to make sure our helpers and volunteers still using social distancing practices to protect our most vulnerable Vermonters.</p>
                          <p>Any volunteers bringing items to people needing help to stay home should:</p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Keep a distance of six feet away.</li>
                            <li>Avoid entering the recipient&#8217;s home.</li>
                            <li>Wash your hands regularly, avoid touching your face and cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.</li>
                            <li>If you feel sick or learn that you have had contact with someone who is sick, stop doing community support work immediately.</li>
                            <li>Keep a list of anyone you come into close contact with in case contact tracing is required.</li>
                            <li>Wear clean gloves when handling items that may be given to people with a weaker immune system, and when you are close to someone who may be sick.</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>Common sense practices can go a long way while Vermonters take care of each other.</p>

                              <p>Emergency medical services (EMS) play a vital role in responding to requests for assistance, triaging patients, and providing emergency medical treatment and transport for ill persons. However, unlike patient care in the controlled environment of a healthcare facility, care and transports by EMS present unique challenges because of the nature of the setting, enclosed space during transport, frequent need for rapid medical decision-making, interventions with limited information, and a varying range of patient acuity and jurisdictional healthcare resources.
