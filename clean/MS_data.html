<p>Mississippi Coronavirus Hotline (8 a.m. &#8211; 5 p.m., Monday through Friday): <strong>877-978-6453</strong></p>

<h2 id="public">Overview</h2>

<p>COVID-19 is a new respiratory virus that causes flu-like illness ranging from mild to severe, with symptoms of fever, coughing, fatigue and difficulty breathing. The CDC and MSDH are working to detect, contain and limit the spread of cases in the U.S. and Mississippi should they occur. MSDH is actively preparing doctors and hospitals on how to respond safely and effectively to COVID-19 in Mississippi.</p>

<p>Like the flu, COVID-19 it is thought to be spread person-to-person by close contact (within 6 feet) and by coughing or sneezing. Other possible routes of transmission, such as touching surfaces contaminated by the virus, are also being investigated.</p>

<h2 id="Mississippi">COVID-19 in Mississippi and the U.S.</h2>

<p>Cases of COVID-19 continue to be identified in U.S. states, and in some areas, person-to-person contact has been identified. This is a rapidly changing situation that is continually being monitored by the CDC and MSDH as more cases in the U.S. are expected.</p>

<p>The risk of infection to the general public in Mississippi remains low, but all Mississippians are advised to take health precautions to prevent the possible transmission of disease.</p>

<div>
<ul>
 <li>Mississippi presumptive positive cases: <strong>6</strong>
</li>
 <li>Individuals tested by the MSDH Public Health Laboratory: <strong>90</strong><br>
 <span>as of March 13, 2020</span>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Presumptive</strong> cases have been identified by MSDH lab testing, and are awaiting further testing by the CDC.</p>

<p><strong>Confirmed</strong> cases have also been determined positive by CDC testing.</p>

<h3>COVID-19 Testing</h3>

<div>
<p>Last week, the MSDH Public Health Laboratory began testing samples submitted by Mississippi physicians and healthcare providers in cases where COVID-19 is a possibility. Anyone with flu-like symptoms, especially those who are older or in poor health, should see a healthcare provider as a matter of general good health. Healthcare providers can assess individual cases which may need specific testing for COVID-19. Test results are typically returned in 24-36 hours.</p>

<h2 id="prevention">Prevention and Preparedness</h2>

<h3>For Individuals</h3>

<p>Preventive measures against COVID-19 are the same as those for other respiratory viruses like the flu. To help prevent getting and spreading disease:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Stay home if you are sick, and avoid close contact with anyone who is ill.</li>
 <li>Cover your coughs and sneezes. When possible, cough, sneeze or blow your nose into a tissue, and throw the tissue away.</li>
 <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.</li>
 <li>Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly, especially after coughing or sneezing, blowing your nose, and using the bathroom. Effective handwashing takes about 20 seconds, and includes cleaning under fingernails, between fingers, and washing the back of hands as well as the front. <a href="14,0,330.html">More proper handwashing tips &#187; </a>
</li>
 <li>Clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that are touched often.</li>
 <li>Stay in good overall health by eating right and staying active. If you are living with diabetes, heart disease or other condition, keep in touch with your doctor and stay current with your treatment.</li>
 <li>During or before flu season, get a flu shot. Flu vaccination can prevent the flu or make it less severe, and decrease your chance of hospitalization and death. It also keeps you healthier and better able to fight off infections.</li>
 <li>If you are sick, especially with shortness of breath, cough, fever or similar flu-like symptoms, call a doctor or healthcare provider.</li>
</ul>

<h4>New recommendations as of March 12, 2020</h4>

<div>
<ul>
 <li>Avoid gatherings of 250 people or more, especially if there is evidence of transmission in your county or adjacent counties . If you do attend, remember to practice the hygiene and distancing steps above.</li>
 <li>To prevent illness in those most vulnerable, anyone 65 or older OR with a chronic medical condition should avoid any gathering of 250 people or more (corrected from 50 earlier).</li>
 <li>Avoid unnecessary (non-urgent) air, bus or train travel.</li>
 <li>Limit visitation to older relatives or friends (especially in nursing or care homes).</li>
 <li>Prepare for the possibility that schools or day care centers may temporarily close.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h3 id="highrisk">For People at High Risk</h3>

<p>People at risk for serious illness from COVID-19 are older adults and those with a chronic illness such as heart disease, diabetes, or lung disease. These people should take simple precautions at all times to limit their exposure to others who may be ill:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Do not attend gatherings of more than 250 people. (Corrected from 50 earlier)</li>
 <li>Keep more space (6 feet if possible) between you and others as you go through the day.</li>
 <li>Avoid crowds. When you do go out in public, keep away from others who are sick and limit close contact.</li>
 <li>Wash your hands often, especially after being in public places.</li>
</ul>

<p>If COVID-19 begins to spread locally, you should stay home as much as possible. Having a supply of important medications and basic supplies can help.</p>

<ul>
 <li><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html">Full recommendations from the CDC for people at high risk</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="facilities">For Long-Term Care Facilities</h3>

<ul>
 <li>MSDH recommends discontinuing group social activities.</li>
 <li>Consider restricting visitation until further notice.</li>
 <li>Post signs that discourage all nonessential visitation and discourage ill visitors from entering the facility.</li>
 <li>Visitors should only visit their family members and should not have contact with other residents since they could spread the virus.</li>
 <li>Visitors should cover their coughs and be educated on the importance of hand hygiene.</li>
 <li>Keep all ill visitors away from the facility for at least 48 hours after symptoms resolve.</li>
 <li>Consider limiting visitation by children (especially during community wide outbreaks) and the elderly or those with underlying medical problems that place them at risk.</li>
 <li>Postpone all groups (like school groups or church groups) from visiting facility &#8212; this goes along with discontinuing all group activities.</li>
 <li>Make sure the facility has plenty of hand washing products and that visitors have access to them.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Schools, Gatherings and Events</h3>

<p>Everyone attending mass gatherings should take extra precautions at this time, including:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Regular hand hygiene with hand sanitizer or soap and water.</li>
 <li>If ill, do not attend any public event and call your physician or healthcare provider if needed.</li>
 <li>Maintain social distancing as much as practical. A separation 6 feet from another person is considered effective for infection control.</li>
 <li>Schools throughout the state should consider cancelling any mass gatherings, including assembly and social events.</li>
 <li>The Mississippi State Department of Health is not advising the closing of schools at this time.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="correctional">Correctional Facilities</h3>

<ul>
 <li>Effective immediately, the Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC) is temporarily suspending visitation at all facilities where MDOC are housed in order to establish sanitation and prevention protocols to prevent the spread of COVID-19.</li>
 <li>Attorneys and essential visitors will be allowed at the facility, and the visiting area will be sanitized upon completion of each visit.</li>
 <li>MDOC is reinforcing common health practices based on preventive measures recommended by the MSDH and the CDC.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Event organizers</strong>: MSDH recommends that communities and organizations contact us at 877-978-6453 to determine whether cancelation is warranted, or appropriate preventive steps for your event.</p>

<h3 id="community">In the Community</h3>

<p>Schools, businesses, events and other places that people gather can take steps to prevent or limit the spread of viral illness.</p>
