                                <p><span>About Coronavirus</span></p>
                                <p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some causing illness in people and
                                    others that circulate among animals, including camels, cats and bats. Rarely, animal
                                    coronaviruses can evolve and infect people and then spread between people such as
                                    has been seen with recent outbreaks of MERS and SARS.</p>
                                <p><span>Questions about Coronavirus? </span></p>
                                <p>If you have questions about coronavirus, please contact the Louisiana 211 Network by dialing dial 211. Or, you can text the keyword LACOVID to 898-211 for the most current information about the outbreak as it becomes available.</p>
                                <p><span>Risk to public is low</span></p>
                                <p>Currently the risk to the general public is low. People with recent travel to China,
                                    or who have come in contact with someone who has recent travel and is ill, have a
                                    greater risk for becoming ill.</p>
                                <p>Reported cases have ranged from mild illness (similar to a common cold) to severe
                                    pneumonia that requires hospitalization. So far, deaths have been reported mainly in
                                    older adults who had other health conditions.</p>
                                <p>To minimize the risk of spread, Louisiana health officials are working with health
                                    care providers to promptly identify and evaluate any suspected cases.</p>
                                <p><span>Symptoms</span></p>
                                <p>For confirmed infections, reported illnesses have ranged from infected people with
                                    little to no symptoms (similar to the common cold) to people being severely ill and
                                    dying. Symptoms can include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Fever</li>
                                    <li>Cough</li>
                                    <li>Shortness of breath/difficulty breathing</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>CDC believes at this time that symptoms of COVID-19 may appear in as few as 2 days or
                                    as long as 14 after exposure.</p>
                                <p>There is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for COVID-19 infection. People
                                    infected with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms.</p>
                                <p><span>How does novel coronavirus spread?</span></p>
                                <p>Health experts are still learning the details about how this new coronavirus spreads.
                                    Other coronaviruses spread from an infected person to others through:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Through respiratory droplets produced when coughing and sneezing</li>
                                    <li>Close personal contact</li>
                                    <li>Touching an object or surface with the virus on it, then touching your mouth,
                                        nose, or eyes</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><span>What you can do</span></p>
                                <p>Anyone who recently traveled to China, who experiences fever, cough, or other acute
                                    illness should contact a health care provider as soon as possible and mention your
                                    recent travel. Please call ahead and inform the health care provider about your
                                    travel history.</p>
                                <p>It is currently flu and respiratory disease season, and flu activity is still high
                                    and expected to continue for a number of weeks. Take steps to avoid spreading germs
                                    from any respiratory diseases by:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Getting a flu vaccine and taking flu antivirals if prescribed.</li>
                                    <li>Covering your cough.</li>
                                    <li>Staying home if you are sick.</li>
                                    <li>Washing your hands.</li>
