                                <p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some causing illness in people and
                                    others that circulate among animals, including camels, cats and bats. Rarely, animal
                                    coronaviruses can evolve and infect people and then spread between people such as
                                    has been seen with recent outbreaks of MERS and SARS.</p>

<p><span>Risk to Public</span></p>
                                <p>To minimize the risk of spread, Louisiana officials are advising the public to practice social distancing by not gathering with large groups of people. Large events and mass gatherings can contribute to the spread of COVID-19 in Louisiana and introduce the virus to new communities.</p>
<p>Examples of large events and mass gatherings include conferences, festivals, parades, concerts, sporting events, weddings, and other types of assemblies. These events can be planned not only by organizations and communities but also by individuals.</p>
<p>The Department of Health is also working with health care providers to promptly identify and evaluate any suspected cases.</p>
<p>Confirmed cases in Louisiana have ranged from mild illness (similar to a common cold) to severe pneumonia that requires hospitalization. So far, deaths have been reported mainly in older adults who had other health conditions.</p>
                                <p><span>Symptoms</span></p>
                                <p>For confirmed infections, reported illnesses have ranged from infected people with
                                    little to no symptoms (similar to the common cold) to people being severely ill and
                                    dying. Symptoms can include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Fever</li>
                                    <li>Cough</li>
                                    <li>Shortness of breath/difficulty breathing</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>CDC believes at this time that symptoms of COVID-19 may appear in as few as 2 days or
                                    as long as 14 after exposure.</p>
                                <p>There is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for COVID-19 infection. People
                                    infected with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms.</p>
                                <p><span>How does novel coronavirus spread?</span></p>
                                <p>Health experts are still learning the details about how this new coronavirus spreads.
                                    Other coronaviruses spread from an infected person to others through:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Through respiratory droplets produced when coughing and sneezing</li>
                                    <li>Close personal contact</li>
                                    <li>Touching an object or surface with the virus on it, then touching your mouth,
                                        nose, or eyes</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><span>What you can do</span></p>
                                <p>Anyone who recently traveled to China, who experiences fever, cough, or other acute
                                    illness should contact a health care provider as soon as possible and mention your
                                    recent travel. Please call ahead and inform the health care provider about your
                                    travel history.</p>
                                <p>It is currently flu and respiratory disease season, and flu activity is still high
                                    and expected to continue for a number of weeks. Take steps to avoid spreading germs
                                    from any respiratory diseases by:</p>
                                    <li>Getting a flu vaccine and taking flu antivirals if prescribed.</li>
                                    <li>Covering your cough.</li>
