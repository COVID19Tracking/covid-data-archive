	<h2>What is COVID-19?</h2>

	<p>COVID-19 is the disease caused by a virus strain that began spreading in people in December 2019.</p>

	<p>Health experts are concerned because little is known about this new respiratory virus, and it can cause severe illness and pneumonia in some people.</p>

	<ul>
<li>The COVID-19 virus was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.</li>
		<li>The COVID-19 virus is not the same as the <a href="/disease/coronavirus.htm">coronaviruses</a>
</li>
		<li>Formerly, this disease was referred to as "2019 Novel Coronavirus" or "2019-nCoV."</li>

<p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in both humans and animals. There are currently seven strains of <a href="/disease/coronavirus.htm">human coronaviruses</a><a href="/library/p-02592.htm"></a></p>

<p>In 2019, a new strain of human coronavirus emerged, COVID-19. Illnesses associated with this virus were first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.</p>

<div>
	<p>The main way COVID-19 is spread to others is when an infected person coughs or sneezes. This is similar to how influenza is spread. The virus is found in droplets from the throat and nose. When someone coughs or sneezes, other people near them can breathe in those droplets. The virus can also spread when someone touches an object with the virus on it. If that person touches their mouth, face, or eyes the virus can make them sick.</p>

	<p>There is much more to learn about the spread, severity, and other features of this virus.</p>

<h4>
<i>&#160;</i>Signs and Symptoms</h4>
<div>

<p>People who have confirmed COVID-19 infections have a range of symptoms, from people with little to no symptoms to people being severely sick and dying. Symptoms can include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fever</li>
	<li>Cough</li>
	<li>Shortness of breath</li>
</ul>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) believes that symptoms of COVID-19 may appear in as few as two days or as long as 14 days after contact with someone who has COVID-19. <strong>If you have been to an <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html">affected geographic area</a></strong></p>

</div>
<h4>
<i>&#160;</i>Prevention and Treatment</h4>
<div>

<p>There is currently no vaccine to prevent COVID-19 infection, and there is currently no specific treatment. The best way to prevent infection is to avoid being exposed to the virus.</p>

<p><strong>Take these steps to help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses:</strong></p>

<p><a href="/library/p-02591.htm"></a></p>

<ul>
<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially before eating and after going to the bathroom, blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.</li>
	<li>If you do not have soap and water, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.</li>
	<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
	<li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
	<li>Stay home when you are sick.</li>
	<li>Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.</li>
	<li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Should we wear face masks when we are out in public?</strong></p>

<p>At this time, CDC does not recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19.</p>

<p>There are specific situations where use of a mask may be recommended. Masks may be used by well people to protect themselves or by ill people to protect others. Situations where use of a mask may be appropriate include:</p>

<ul>
<li>To protect themselves, health care workers who are providing care to people with respiratory symptoms use masks specifically designed for use in health care settings.</li>
	<li>To protect others, people who are experiencing symptoms of a respiratory illness (e.g. cough, fever) and are going to a clinic for medical care are asked to wear a surgical masks to prevent exposing other patients or health care providers to respiratory droplets. These are sometimes used in other public situations by ill people to protect others.</li>
	<li>Health care providers may recommend that some people who have weakened immune systems wear face masks in public for protection from respiratory infections.</li>
	<li>To protect themselves, healthy people may choose to wear surgical masks if they are caring for someone who is sick with a respiratory illness at home.</li>

<i>&#160;</i><strong>General Travel Guidance</strong>
</h4>
<div>

<p><strong>International Travel</strong></p>

<p>Currently the CDC and the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) recommend the following with respect to international travel:</p>

<ul>
<li>All travelers should avoid nonessential travel to countries with <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/after-travel-precautions.html">Level 3 Travel Notices</a>
</li>
	<li>Older adults and those with chronic conditions should avoid all nonessential travel.</li>
</ul>
<p>CDC and DHS recommend that all travelers, particularly those with underlying health conditions, defer all cruise ship travel worldwide. Older adults and travelers with underlying health issues should avoid situations that put them at increased risk for more severe disease, such as nonessential travel such as long plane trips, and cruise ships.</p>

<p>DHS issued guidance for travelers on a cruise in Egypt:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you were on a cruise in Egypt and you have symptoms like fever or respiratory illness, call your provider to be tested and quarantine at home immediately.</li>
	<li>If you were on a cruise in Egypt and do not have symptoms, call your local health department and quarantine at home immediately.</li>
	<li>If you have been in close contact with someone who has been on a cruise in Egypt and is ill, you also need to quarantine at home and inform your local health department.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Domestic Travel</strong></p>

<p>Though there are areas within the U.S. where there is &#8220;community transmission&#8221; of COVID-19, the CDC has not issued recommendations related to travel within the U.S. In the absence of such guidance and with the goal of delaying the onset of community transmission of COVID-19 in Wisconsin, DHS recommends the following domestic travel-related measures:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>DHS recommends against all nonessential travel to any U.S. state where the CDC deems there is &#8220;community transmission&#8221; of COVID-19</strong>.<br>
		More information can be found at: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html">CDC Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the U.S. webpage</a>
</li>
	<li>For all travelers returning to Wisconsin from U.S. states where the CDC has determined that community transmission is occurring, <strong>DHS recommends that those individuals self-quarantine at home for 14 days and monitor for symptoms of COVID-19 </strong>(including fever and cough). Instructions on how to self-quarantine and self-monitor for symptoms, are available on this page in the next section.</li>

<h4>
<i>&#160;</i>Frequently Asked Questions for Returning Travelers</h4>
<div>

<p><strong>What does Level 3 country mean, and what countries does CDC currently consider to be Level 3 because of higher risk for getting sick with COVID-19?</strong></p>

<p>Level 3 means that in these countries, people in the community are easily getting sick and spreading the COVID-19 virus. For these countries, CDC has issued a Level 3 Travel Health Notice. Not every country with cases of COVID-19 is considered Level 3 at this time.<br>
	More can be found at: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html">CDC&#8217;s Coronavirus Disease 2019 Information for Travel webpage</a></p>

<p><strong>What states currently have community transmission?</strong></p>

<p>For the most up-to-date list of U.S. states with community transmission, visit the CDC&#8217;s Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the U.S. webpage.<br>
	More can be found at: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html">CDC Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the U.S. webpage</a></p>

<p><strong>Should I stay home if I was in a Level 3 country or a U.S. state with community transmission during the last 14 days?</strong></p>

<p>Yes. People who spent time in of these regions with increased COVID-10 risk are asked to complete a 14-day voluntary self-quarantine. This means that for 14 days, you stay in your home and away from other people to prevent you from accidentally making other people sick. If you have been to China or Iran, your local health department will be in contact with you. If you caught the virus in another country, you may not become sick for up to two weeks after leaving that country. You may even give the virus to other people before you realize you are sick. If you stay home for 14 days and never get any symptoms of COVID-19, then you don&#8217;t have to be in quarantine anymore. If you do get sick but are in self-quarantine, the chances of you giving the virus to anyone else here in Wisconsin are much lower. The whole idea is to prevent other people from getting sick (see detailed instructions below).</p>

<p>Please see "Self-Quarantine, Self-Isolation, and Self-Monitoring Guidance" below for instructions after returning from a Level 3 Country or a U.S. state with community transmission.</p>

<p><strong>What if I ONLY spent time in an airport in a Level 3 country or state with community transmission?</strong></p>

<p>At this time you are not being asked to quarantine yourself if your only time was in an airport. However, you should still monitor yourself for symptoms of COVID-19 and follow the instructions outlined below for what to do if you become ill or need to see a doctor.</p>

<p><strong>What if I spent time in a country with a CDC Level 2 Travel Health Alert?</strong></p>

<p>At this time you are not being asked to quarantine yourself if you were only in a Level 2 country. However, you should still monitor yourself for symptoms of COVID-19 and follow the instructions outlined below for what to do if you become ill or need to see a doctor. You should also limit your interactions with other people and large groups for 14 days after you return.</p>

<p><strong>Why am I being asked to quarantine myself if I am not sick?</strong></p>

<p>A quarantine is a preventive step to help stop the spread of diseases. It is the isolation of people who are not sick, but who were exposed to a disease and have the potential to become sick. People are quarantined during the time they might become sick. For COVID-19, most people will become sick within 14 days of their exposure if they were infected. Quarantining yourself while you are not sick allows you to limit the number of people you have contact with in the event you become sick. This means you limit the number of people who could become sick from having contact with you because sometimes people can spread a disease before they know they are sick.</p>

<p><strong>How do I reach my local health department if I have additional questions or need their assistance?</strong></p>

<p>Your local or tribal health department is determined by where you live, please see the <a href="/lh-depts/counties.htm">DHS Local Public Health</a></p>

	<li>Consider minimizing contact with people and animals in your home (stay in your own room and, if possible, use your own bathroom). Avoid sharing personal household items such as dishes, towels, and bedding.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How do I monitor myself for symptoms of COVID-19?</strong></p>

<p>For the 14 days after you leave a Level 3 country or state with community transmission, you should monitor yourself (watch yourself) for symptoms.</p>

<p>Self-monitoring instructions:</p>

<ul>
<li>If possible, take your temperature twice a day with a thermometer. A fever is typically a temperature of 100.4&#176;F or greater. If you do not have a thermometer, symptoms of fever may including feeling unusually hot for no reason, having chills or having the sweats.</li>
	<li>Watch for fever, cough, or trouble breathing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What should I do if I get a fever, cough, or am having trouble breathing, or need medical care?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Call your health care provider. Call ahead before you go to your doctor&#8217;s office or to an emergency room. Tell them your symptoms and that you traveled to an area experiencing a community transmission of COVID-19.</li>
	<li>Do not use public transportation, ride-sharing, or taxis.</li>
	<li>If you have a facemask, wear it if you need to be around other people.</li>
	<li>Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough and sneeze.</li>

<h4>
<i>&#160;</i>Guidance for Employers</h4>
<div>

<p><strong>What can you do to help if you have an employee who is being asked to stay home from work by public health?</strong></p>

<p>In order to reduce the impact of missed work on employees who are being monitored, public health may ask employers to make reasonable accommodations to allow the employee to work from home or a protected area (e.g., closed office), depending on their level of risk and in coordination with the employer.</p>

<p><strong>What can I do to prepare my business or workplace in the event that COVID-19 becomes more widespread in our community?</strong></p>

<p>We recommend all employers have a plan for what they can do in the event that COVID-19 becomes widespread in the community. The goals for your plan should be to reduce the spread of acute respiratory illnesses and minimize the impact of COVID-19 among your employees. Strategies should help in:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reducing transmission among staff</li>
	<li>Protecting people who are at higher risk for adverse health complications</li>
	<li>Maintaining business operations</li>
	<li>Minimizing adverse effects on other entities in your supply chain</li>
</ul>

<h5>Responses to common questions about testing</h5>

<p><strong>Where should I send specimens?</strong><br>
	Many commercial and clinical labs are now performing COVID-19 testing. If your health system is performing large numbers of tests (such as drive through testing sites, testing of ill health care workers, etc.) these specimens should be sent to commercial labs. Health plans have been asked to waive cost-sharing for COVID-19 laboratory and radiology testing.</p>

<p><strong>How will we get patient results?</strong><br>
	As with other testing, clinicians can expect results to be communicated directly from the lab. Please do not contact the Department of Health Services or your local health department for test results.</p>

<p><strong>How will my patient get their results?</strong><br>
	As with other testing, clinicians should share test results with patients directly. Please do NOT tell patients to contact their local health department or DHS for test results, or updates on the status of their testing.</p>

<p><strong>Are there any recommendations from DHS about who should not be tested?</strong><br>
	Clinicians should use their judgment to determine if a patient has signs and symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and whether the patient should be tested. Asymptomatic individuals should NOT be tested. Priority should be given for patients with known exposure to a person with COVID-19, severely ill patients requiring hospitalization, and patients with significant comorbidities.</p>

<p>Patients with mild upper respiratory symptoms not requiring medical care generally do not need testing, but they should be advised to remain out of contact with others until their symptoms fully resolve.&#160; Please see: <strong>Updates to COVID-19 Testing Procedures, <a href="/dph/memos/communicable-diseases/bcd-2020-03.pdf">BCD memo 2020-03, issued March 9</a></strong>.</p>
