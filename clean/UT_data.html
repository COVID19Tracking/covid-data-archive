  <p>The Utah Coronavirus Task Force is actively monitoring the spread of COVID-19 on a state, national, and global level.</p>

The Utah Department of Health is working with local health departments, healthcare providers, and other public health partners throughout the state to monitor illness associated with this new coronavirus and to prevent further spread.
<p>The department has activated its Incident Command System in order to ensure effective communication and coordination with all involved agencies.</p>
<p></p>
<p>While the origin of this particular outbreak can be traced back to China, it would be grossly inappropriate, not to mention medically ineffective, to ostracize anyone from our communities or exclude anyone from our places of public gathering based on their race, nationality, or ethnicity.</p>
<p>Many rumors related to COVID-19 circulating on social media are false or contain misinformation. People should be skeptical of rumors they hear on social media that aren&#8217;t being reported by reputable health organizations or mainstream media outlets and should not share or repost items unless they are able to confirm that they are true. False and inaccurate social media posts can cause a great deal of harm.</p>
<p>Even though this is a worrisome public health situation, the immediate health risk from COVID-19 to the general public is believed to be low. We can all contribute to a healthy community, and we appreciate your willingness to help protect the public health in Utah.</p>

  <p>There are more than 1,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the U.S., and those numbers are expected to rise as testing becomes more widespread.</p>
