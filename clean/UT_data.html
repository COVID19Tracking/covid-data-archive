<h3><b>*Laboratory Data Note: </b></h3>
<p>The actual number of people tested for COVID-19 in Utah is considerably higher than the numbers in this report because some large private laboratories are not yet reporting negative results to public health. UDOH will update these data as they are available. Additionally, laboratory positives may not match confirmed cases due to ongoing investigations and confirmatory testing.</p>
